Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended British boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having previously studied and written music, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\".

He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.\r\n\r\nMercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and was posthumously featured on their final album, Made in Heaven (1995).

The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's death in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which, Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.\r\n\r\nCategorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, with their later music featuring more electronica and pop elements.

The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's eighth album, From Zero (2024), returned to more of their original sound while also incorporating musical elements from all of their previous records.\r\n\r\nLinkin Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared \"the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.", "founded": "1996-01-01", "disbanded": null, "country": 1}}, {"model": "viewer.musicgroup", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Queen", "bio": "Formed in 1970, Queen was a British rock band whose classic line-up consisted of Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and piano, Brian May on lead guitar, Roger Taylor on drums, and John Deacon on bass. Although Mercury and May wrote the bulk of the band’s material, all four contributed to the songwriting, churning out huge hits. Initially a progressive rock band with strong metal influences, their sound evolved dramatically over time. The band went on to refine, if not define “stadium rock,” as they grew to become one of the most beloved rock bands of all time.\r\n\r\nTheir early progressive phase spawned epic tracks like “March of the Black Queen” and one international hit single: “Killer Queen”. But it was their 1975 track “Bohemian Rhapsody” which catapulted the group to super-stardom. The song reigned at #1 on the UK charts for nine weeks and has since been praised as one of the greatest songs of all time.\r\n\r\nMoving away from their album-orientated sound, the band only grew in popularity with such songs as “Somebody to Love”, “We Are the Champions”, “Don’t Stop Me Now”, “Another One Bites the Dust”, “Radio Ga Ga” and many more. These songs are so beloved that a musical based on the band’s discography, titled We Will Rock You, became one of West-End’s longest-running shows with a 12-year run through May 2014—and more events being featured internationally, as well.\r\n\r\nIn November 2018, Queen’s popularity rose with the Oscar-winning biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody. The movie’s climax, Queen’s Live Aid charity performance, had already gone down in history as one of the greatest live concerts in music history. At the time, in mid-1985, the show was pivotal to Queen’s legacy on a global scale.\r\n\r\nAfter Live Aid event, Queen released their 12th studio album, 1986’s A Kind of Magic, and embarked on their final stadium run: The Magic Tour. In 1995, Queen released their 15th studio album, Made in Heaven, culled from vocals recorded before Freddie Mercury’s death in November 1991, due to complications related to AIDS. This occurred just nine months after the February release of Queen’s 14th studio album, Innuendo, which was heralded as their best effort in years.\r\n\r\nDeacon retired from music in 1997, after he, May, and Taylor recorded the Freddie Mercury tribute song “No-One But You (Only the Good Die Young)”; May and Taylor would continue to tour as Queen, with stand-in lead vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.\r\n\r\nQueen has been a huge influence in the past 50 years, influencing bands and solo acts alike such as Prince, Metallica, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Nirvana, and many, many more.", "founded": "1970-01-01", "disbanded": null, "country": 11}}, {"model": "viewer.musicgroup", "pk": 76, "fields": {"name": "Skupina F.
