      "bio": "Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 – July 20, 2017) was an American singer who was the lead vocalist of the rock band Linkin Park. He was also the lead vocalist of Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple Pilots at various points in his career.\r\n\r\nBennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the bestselling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. He continued as the band's lead vocalist for their next six studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), with each charting within the top three spots of the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nBennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).\r\n\r\nBennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. The coroner concluded that his death was a result of suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the \"Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.\" Bennington has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation. Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington \"turned nu-metal universal\"."

      "bio": "Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter who achieved global fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended British boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having previously studied and written music, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.\r\n\r\nMercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and was posthumously featured on their final album, Made in Heaven (1995). In 1991, the day after publicly announcing his diagnosis, he died from complications of the disease at the age of 45. In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness.\r\n\r\nAs a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. One year after his death, Mercury received the same award individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons."

Her parents were prominent members of the Church of Scientology, and she was raised as a Scientologist. She started to write songs and play guitar when she was 11, and began to sing when she was 15. She dropped out of high school; she said she wanted to be in a rock band and had no interest in pursuing anything else. In an interview with the El Paso Times in 2012, Armstrong said music was the one thing that kept her motivated in life.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nDead Sara\r\n\r\nArmstrong with Dead Sara in Akvárium, Budapest\r\nIn 2002, Armstrong began playing with guitarist Siouxsie Medley, who she met through a mutual friend. They had similar taste in music; both Medley and Armstrong were influenced by Nirvana and L7, among others, and 1960s and 1970s folk and blues artists and classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell, and Fleetwood Mac.\r\n\r\nInitially known as Epiphany, Dead Sara's first gig was at the Los Angeles nightclub The Mint in March 2005. In addition to singing, Armstrong played the bass.\r\n\r\nAs a songwriter, Armstrong was significantly influenced by folk rock. Her interest in open and alternate tunings, such as those used by Mitchell, resulted in what Guitar World referred to as Dead Sara's signature sound. As a performer, she was influenced by artists including Iggy Pop and Janis Joplin.\r\n\r\nArmstrong received significant attention as a singer before Dead Sara's debut was released. Noting her \"strong, urgent sound\", Grace Slick said Armstrong was a singer she admired in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in 2011, and Courtney Love brought Armstrong to New York to sing on Hole's 2010 album, Nobody's Daughter.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Linkin Park, she recorded and/or performed live with artists including the Offspring, Beck, Demi Lovato, Awolnation, and Robby Krieger of the Doors."

      "bio": "Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's death in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which, Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.\r\n\r\nCategorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, with their later music featuring more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\", and \"In the End\" all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation's Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\r\n\r\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's eighth album, From Zero (2024), returned to more of their original sound while also incorporating musical elements from all of their previous records.\r\n\r\nLinkin Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared \"the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.",

      "bio": "Formed in 1970, Queen was a British rock band whose classic line-up consisted of Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and piano, Brian May on lead guitar, Roger Taylor on drums, and John Deacon on bass. Although Mercury and May wrote the bulk of the band’s material, all four contributed to the songwriting, churning out huge hits. Initially a progressive rock band with strong metal influences, their sound evolved dramatically over time. The band went on to refine, if not define “stadium rock,” as they grew to become one of the most beloved rock bands of all time.\r\n\r\nTheir early progressive phase spawned epic tracks like “March of the Black Queen” and one international hit single: “Killer Queen”. But it was their 1975 track “Bohemian Rhapsody” which catapulted the group to super-stardom. The song reigned at #1 on the UK charts for nine weeks and has since been praised as one of the greatest songs of all time.\r\n\r\nMoving away from their album-orientated sound, the band only grew in popularity with such songs as “Somebody to Love”, “We Are the Champions”, “Don’t Stop Me Now”, “Another One Bites the Dust”, “Radio Ga Ga” and many more. These songs are so beloved that a musical based on the band’s discography, titled We Will Rock You, became one of West-End’s longest-running shows with a 12-year run through May 2014—and more events being featured internationally, as well.\r\n\r\nIn November 2018, Queen’s popularity rose with the Oscar-winning biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody. The movie’s climax, Queen’s Live Aid charity performance, had already gone down in history as one of the greatest live concerts in music history. At the time, in mid-1985, the show was pivotal to Queen’s legacy on a global scale.\r\n\r\nAfter Live Aid event, Queen released their 12th studio album, 1986’s A Kind of Magic, and embarked on their final stadium run: The Magic Tour. In 1995, Queen released their 15th studio album, Made in Heaven, culled from vocals recorded before Freddie Mercury’s death in November 1991, due to complications related to AIDS. This occurred just nine months after the February release of Queen’s 14th studio album, Innuendo, which was heralded as their best effort in years.\r\n\r\nDeacon retired from music in 1997, after he, May, and Taylor recorded the Freddie Mercury tribute song “No-One But You (Only the Good Die Young)”; May and Taylor would continue to tour as Queen, with stand-in lead vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.\r\n\r\nQueen has been a huge influence in the past 50 years, influencing bands and solo acts alike such as Prince, Metallica, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Nirvana, and many, many more.",

Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and eventual divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band as well as the concepts of music theory and combining different styles. It is also the band's only album in which bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell does not play, however, he is credited as a member of the band as well as a songwriter on some of its tracks.",
